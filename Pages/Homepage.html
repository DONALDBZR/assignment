            <h1>Welcome to ICACIE 2022</h1>
            <p>
                ICACIE 2022 focuses on all aspects of theory and applications in
                various areas of advanced computing and intelligent engineering.
                ICACIE is a multidisciplinary conference organized with the
                objective of bringing together academicians, scientists,
                researchers from industry, research scholars as well as students
                working in all areas of advanced computing and intelligent
                engineering. The conference will provide the authors along with
                the listeners with opportunities for national, international
                collaboration, networking among universities as well as
                institutions from Mauritius and abroad for promoting research
                and developing technologies. This conference's aim is to promote
                the translation of basic research into applied investigation and
                then into the practice. This conference will also create
                awareness about the importance of basic scientific research in
                different fields matching with the current trends. The
                conference will provide the flavor of keynote lectures by
                eminent speakers from different areas & panel discussion by
                industry people. The scope of the conference includes all areas
                of Advanced Computing and Intelligent Engineering.
